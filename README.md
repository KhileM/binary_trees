A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and it serves as the starting point for traversing or searching the tree. Nodes in a binary tree are connected by edges, with each node having a parent node (except for the root) and zero, one, or two children nodes. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science and data structures for various applications, including search algorithms, sorting algorithms, and representing hierarchical structures like file systems or organization charts.
